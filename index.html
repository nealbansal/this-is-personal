        <h2>Cooks and Soldiers</h2>
        <h4>Atlanta, GA</h4>
        <p> Atlanta boasts several amazing restaurants. But one of the best is Cooks and Soldiers. This Spanish tapas restaurant is raved as one of the best casual eating establishments in Atlanta. They offer many varieties of food from seafood to meat. My favorite is the grilled octopus. </p>

        <h2>Georgia Aquarium</h2>
        <h4> Atlanta, GA</h4>
        <p>You will never see fish the same again after you visit the Georgia Aquarium. Home to the most aquatic life than any other aquarium, it has fun stuff for all ages. The aquarium houses several exhibits throughout the aquarium, looking at marine life from all different backgrounds. You can see the alligators in the swamps or the different jellyfish across the ocean. You can also be entertained by a dolphin show or get splashed at the sea lion show. But if you are tired of looking at the varieties of fish, you can have a whole new experience and jump right in with them.</p>

          <h2>Mercedes-Benz Stadium</h2>
        <h4> Atlanta, GA</h4>
        <p>For all of you sports fans, welcome to the greatest stadium in America. That's right. This new stadium houses the Atlanta Falcons and Atlanta United FC, two premiere teams when it comes to football and soccer. Both teams boast extreme success, but the stadium could arguably be even better. With a gorgeous retractable roof and a 360 scoreboard, the stadium is state-of-the-art. It also comes with amazing food at affordable prices. No paying $5 for a hot dog. Instead, enjoy a high quality hot dog for the same price you'd see anywhere else.</p>

        <h2>National Center for Civil and Human Rights</h2>
        <h4> Atlanta, GA</h4>
        <p>Atlanta is rich in history. From the beginning, slavery was a major part of our history. But as we moved on, Atlanta slowly became a better place for all. Atlanta has struggled through major racial tension and unrest. But now they have changed and the National Center for Civil and Human Rights hopes to document that. The museum highlights the horrible history of America when it comes to racism. It focuses on the civil rights movement and it's progress towards equality along with the influence of Atlanta native Martin Luther King Jr. It also talks about human rights violations across the world and what we as citizens can do to help make the world a better place.</p>

        <h2>World of Coca-Cola</h2>
        <h4>Atlanta, GA</h4>
        <p>The next stop you must visit is the World of Coca-Cola. I know what you are thinking: I have to go to Atlanta to drink Coke? Well not exactly. The history of Coca-Cola has deep roots in Georgia. It was founded and developed in Georgia and is now headquartered here. Throughout the World of Coca-Cola, you get to experience the history of the legendary drink and see the bottling process that billions of soda bottles go through every day. Plus, you can see hundreds of Coke commercials from around the world. But by far the best part is "Taste It!" It features different Coke products from around the world!</p>
